# PacMan-Maze

To run the experiment, assuming you are in the root folder of this project, simply run

``` bash
$ python experiments/pacman_maze/run.py --show-run --overlay-prediction
```

Note that the `--show-run` flag tells the system to visualize the real-time training process.
This would only work if GUI is present in the system.
`--overlay-prediction` is used for visualizing the model predictions.
